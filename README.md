# AdeptOS

Hello Engineer, and welcome to AdeptOS repo. It is a scripting framework for a game Space Engineers by Keen Software. You may want to go to [Wiki](https://github.com/momoadept/FleetCommand/wiki/1.-Overview) to read about it.

## State of affairs
Current version is v0.1.1-pre-alpha. We have the framework but not much else. Breaking changes expected soon.

## Plans for the nearest future
- Modules for building player-accessible menus
- Modules for ship bureaucracy (assigning ship and PB names, tags, etc)
- Modules for ship movement (remote control, precision movement, docking)
- Modules for inventory management
- Optimizations for Async scheduling
- Optimizations for Sequencing
